# Complementary Strand Binding Experiment
Written by Harshu Musunuri, 5/25/19, *Performed:* TBD

Procedure Purpose
=================
Use TdT extension as a gauge for whether our complementary strand is effectively binding to the starting strand to determine whether this is a possible explanation for cutback we've observed during the ExoT reaction. 

Overview 
=================
Since we postulated that secondary structures forming with the starting strand are what are causing poor binding with the complementary strands and leading to excess ExoT cutback into the double stranded region, we wanted to test how well these were bound by running a simple test.
This experiment takes advantage of the fact that terminal transferase has been shown to have poor rates of extension on "native" or double stranded DNA, but speeds up considerably (by an order of magnitude) when exposed to "primer DNA" that is single stranded. 
For this reason, we will be exposing the starting strand by itself, the starting strand with its 2 comp strand variants, as well as the modified strands with its 2 comp strand variants to TdT for a minute, and then observe any differences in product lenghts to draw conclusions about how well the primers were bound.

*1 bp overhang shouldn't be an issue because single stranded region needs to be atleast a 5-6 bp long in order for TdT to start attach and function.

Number of sample corresponds to the lane in which it will be placed in the gel: 
1. Ladder
2. BS_Start Original (Extension Control)
3. BS_Start Original (Negative Control)
4. BS_Start Original with BS_Start_Comp_5
5. BS_Start_Mod with BS_Start_Mod_Comp5

Procedure
=========
## Complementary DNA Binding 
1. Add 4 uL of ~40 ng/uL 'BS_Start' into tubes 2, 3, and 4 and 4 uL of 'BS_Start_modified" into tubes 5, 6, and 7.
2. Add 4μL of dilute ‘BS_Comp_5"to tube 4. 
3. Add 4μL of dilute 'BS_Start_Mod1_Comp5' to tube 6. 
4. Add 2 uL of water to each of the 4 tubes and mix thoroughly.
5. Set one thermocycler, Thermocycler 1, to hold at 94◦C for two minutes, then lower the temperatureto 10◦C forever (decreasing at 0.5◦C per second). Place all sample tubes into Thermocycler 1 and start the protocol (let this run for atleast 30 minutes). 

## TdT Extension Reaction
1. Set one thermocycler to incubate at 37C for 2 minutes, 90C for ten minutes, then hold at 4C.
2. Pipette 0.8 ul of water, 2 uL of 10x TdT Buffer, and 2 uL 10x CoCl2 into tubes 
4. Pipette 4 uL of 10 mM 'dTTP dilute' into both tubes, and place in thermocycler. 
5. Immediately before starting the protocol, add 1.2 uL of 20 U/uL TdT to both tubes (total reaction volume of 20 uL). 
6. After thermocycler protocol is done, remove and get samples ready for gel running.

## Gel Setup 

1.  Remove two 20% polyacrylamide gels from pouches and rinse with deionized water.
2.  Peel off tape on bottom of 20% polyacrylamide gels and remove combs.
3.  Lower  the  Buffer  Core  (the  piece  that  holds  the  gels)  into  the  Lower  Buffer  Chamber  so  that  the negative electrode fits into the opening in the gold plate.
4.  Insert the Gel Tension Wedge into the XCell Surelock behind the buffer core. Make sure it is in its‘unlocked’ position, which allows the wedge to slip into the unit.
5.  Insert gel cassettes into the lower buffer chamber.  The shorter “well” side of the cassette faces intothe buffer core.  The slot on the back must face outward.  If only one gel is being run, insert a bufferdam in the place of a gel cassette.
6.  Pull forward on the Gel Tension Lever toward the buffer core until the gel cassettes are snug againstthe buffer core.  This puts it in the ’locked’ position.
7.  Fill the Upper Buffer Chamber (between the gels) with running buffer.  Ensure it is not leaking.
8.  Fill the Lower Buffer Chamber completely with running buffer by pouring TBE next to the Gel TensionWedge.
9.  Pipette 12μL of running buffer into each gel well.
10.  Place the gel cover on the apparatus in the correct orientation.  Connect the electrodes to the powersource, and pre-run the gel for 30 min at 150 V. 

## Gel Loading/ Running

1.  Obtain small gel running tubes. Pipette  5μL  of  2x  Gel  Loading  Buffer  II  into each well of two rows of these tubes. 
2.  For  the  ladder  well,  load  4μL  of  .5X  TBE  Buffer  into  the  already  present  5μL  Loading  Buffer  II droplets.  Load 1μL of 10/60 Ladder, and mix well by pipetting upand down.
3.  For the remaining gel wells, load 5μL of the appropriate extension or test sample into the 5μL droplet of Gel Loading Buffer II (contains 18 mM EDTA), mix well, and then load 5μL of the mixture directlyinto the appropriate gel well. This should result in approximately 30 ng/lane on a gel (depending on the sample) which is within the target of 20-40 ng per lane.
4.  Run the gels at 150 V until the dark blue dye is three quarters of the way to the bottom of the gel.  If the dark blue dye is not visible, run the gel for three hours.
5. While the gel runs, prepare 1X SYBR Gold Staining Solution with TBE as dilute.
6.  Once gel has finished running, submerge gel in SYBR Gold solution for 20 minutes.
